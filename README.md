## Secrets : 
Currently you need to implement a class to point to your desired mongo URL.
For some reason extensions enviroment is tricky

## Experiments :
Here you find python source files. This are mostly to retrieve stats about how people use angular components. Python could be useful to extract data and
get a better view of common design patterns and posible optimizations for good coding practices that this extension could achieve. 

## Current status: 
For the moment I will be analyzing how people use inline styles to get a better idea what source to source command work first, of course... to make this decision I will have to evaluate how 
hard is that task and how useful it is. I tend to abuse inline styles a lot while creating my components, so thats why I am working in that command, but maybe there are better things
that this extension could do.
